# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project uses PyTorch to build a regression model for predicting house prices based on the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset contains 13 features related to housing in the Boston area, and the target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes.

## Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset includes the following features:
- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- **TAX**: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **B**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town.
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status of the population.
- **PRICE**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable).
